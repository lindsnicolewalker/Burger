## Description
Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, my app will display the burger on the designated section of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the appropriate side of the page, waiting to be made, next to a Make! button.
My app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
Check out this video of the app for a run-through of how it works.
